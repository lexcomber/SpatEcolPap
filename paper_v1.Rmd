# Abstract
TBC

# 1. Introduction
This paper emphasises the need for *Geography Googles* in applied geographical analyses of data that increasingly have a spatial comonent in the form of location, for instance form GPS. It argues that *space is special* and encourages explicitly spatial ways of thinking. These ideas are posited in the context of nearly all data being spatial (i.e location is included), and the need for slightly more informed approaches for analysing space and location than provided by standard statistical models. 

\textbf{Blah blah blah (Lex to complete but any suggestions welcome)}

The paper tests the model suggested by Coudun et al (2006) but does this using a Geographically Weighted (GW) frameworks (Brunsdon et al, 1996) such as GW Regression (GWR), a spatial dependence model. Coudun et al (2006) found the presence of *Acer campestre* in France to be significantly related to two factors rainfall and evapotranspiration. Here Coudon’s analysis is extended to account for spatial autocorrelation in the variables which occurs when changes in properties of nearby features are found to be correlated and this contradicts the underlying assumption of independence in statistical analysis and inference. The result is spatial non-stationarity when the statistical pattern or relationship observed in one location differs from that in another. To explore these, this paper applies a GWR analysis to examine the spatial variation in the relationships between the predictor variables and Acer campestre presence to test for the presence of local, non-stationary relationships.

# 2. Background

## 2.1 Need for explicitly spatial methods 
\textbf{TBC - Harry?}

- Need: location is not just another variable - Key concept in spatial statistics / quant geog
- Review: GWR Not the first – similar ideas found in: Crop science (Fischer & Gosset 1935), Meteorology (Kolmogorov 1941; Gandin 1965); Mining (Krige 1951; Matheron 1963); Forestry (Matérn 1960); Theory (Yaglom 1955); Euripides: *Slight not what’s near, though aiming for what is far*
- Spatial statistics paradigms: Geostatistical models; Spatial regression models; Spatial point process models; Spatial ecology models; Spatial movement (trajectories) models; Spatial interaction models; Geographically weighted models etc: Point is that you choose one according to: (i) spatial process, (ii) spatial data type, (iii) inferential framework & (iv) research objectives
- Very brief overview of the GWR paradigm – detail is in sections later? And extensions

## 2.2 Review of spatial methods in ecology and conservation 
\textbf{TBC - Duccio?}
Understanding species distribution is a key concept in ecological research, in particular when dealing with biodiversity monitoring for conservation practices. Several papers have dealt with the importance of explicitly taking space into account when trying to model the distribution of a certain species, and, overall, its change in space and time.
The description of the distribution of biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales
has long been the focus of ecology and biogeography. Reliable descriptions of species distributions
are fundamental for conservation and research purposes (Dormann, 2007). A number of statistical problems must be solved before spatial models can be built such as: the uncertainty related to the sampling of the modelled species (Rocchini et al., 2011), the correlation among predictors (Dormann et al....), the potential variability over space of the predictors being used (Rocchin et al., 2016, CAGEO), the spatio-temporal dependency of the predictors (Zuur and Ieno, 2016). 
Among these, spatial non stationairty and scale dependence ar expected to impact most of the ecological processes and relative patterns such as the distribution of biodiversity over space (Foody, 2004). 
In general , spatial ecological models assume stationarity of predictor variables.......

## 3.1 Data and Study Area

Data recorded between 1980 and 2010 describing the presence of *Acer campestre* was downloaded from GBIF using the `dismo` R package, and subsetted for the UK. The data contained 22,701 records whose spatial distribution are shown in Figure 1, with a median of `r summary(colSums(res.vec))[3]`  records per year, a 1st quartile of `r summary(colSums(res.vec))[2]`  and a `r summary(colSums(res.vec))[4]` quartile of 917 records. The data for all years were summed over Ordnance Survey 10km grids because of the uneven distribution in time and space. Potential alternative approaches including generating absence points, background data (Phillips et al. 2009) to charcaterise study area environments or pseudo-absences (eg VanDerWal et al., 2009), indicating where absences might occur. However, pseudo absence approaches require a number of assumptions and lack statistical methods for handling the overlap between presence and background points (Ward et al. 2009; Phillips and Elith, 2011), absence data may be biased and or incomplete (Kery et al., 2010) and background data approaches generate the same measures irrespective of where the species is observed (Hijmans and Elith, 2015).

```


The study by Coudun et al (2006) found the presence of *Acer campestre* to be significantly related to Autumn rainfall and actual Thornthwaite evapotranspiration. In this study rainfall, Potential evapotranspiration (PET) and wildness index data were used to construct a series of models for predicting the density of *Acer campestre* occurance. Data on rainfall were downloaded from the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (Tanguy et al, 2015) which provides monthly 1km estimated rainfall data for each year. The average Autumn (3 month) rainfall was calculated for each 1km. Mean annual PET data were downloaded from the CGIAR Consortium for Spatial Information (Trabucco and Zomer, 2009) which provides global data at textbf\{0.0083 degrees, approximately 1km}. Finally, a wilder dataset was included in the model. This was to explore the degree to the presence of *Acer campestre* may be related to anthropogenic disturbance – anecdotally this species is frequently found in field margins and hedges. The Wilderness Quality Index data were generated for the whole of Europe at 1km resolution as described in Kuiters et al (2011) and can be considered as measure of non-anthropogenic activity. Each of these datasets were spatially aggregated over the OS 10m grid cells to generate mean values as shown in Figure 2.

## 3.2 Analysis

A multi-stage analysis was applied to model Acer campestre distributions. First, exploratory analyses were undertaken using a standard OLS regression to model distributions as an initial step. This identified significant predictor variables, under the assumption that relationships between predictor variables (rainfall, PET and wilderness) and species distributions are stationary (i.e. global). Then a GWR analysis was applied to examine the spatial variation in the relationships between the predictor variables and *Acer campestre* distributions (i.e. to test for the presence of local, non-stationary relationships). In overview, GW approaches use a moving window or kernel that passes through the study area. At each location being considered, data under the window are used to make a local calculation of some kind, such as a regression. The data are weighted by their distance to the kernel centre and in this way GW approaches construct a series of models at discrete locations in the study area. This is in contrast to global models, that consider all of the data (usually) in a single analysis of all data in the study area. 

Next, the presence of local collinearity amongst the predictor variables was tested. This is a critical step in any GWR analysis but one that is usually overlooked. Collinearity occurs when variables exhibit linear or near linear relationships. Strong collinearity will affect model reliability and precision, generate unstable parameter estimates, inflated standard errors and inferential biases (Dormann et al 2013), and there may be problems in separating variable effects (Meloun et al. 2002). In a GWR analyses, collinearity may occur locally, with the construction of localised regressions, even when it is not observed globally (Wheeler and Tiefelsdorf, 2005; Wheeler 2007, 2009, 2013; Brunsdon et al 2012). A number of approaches exist to address collinearity in regression modelling, such as partial least squares regression, principal component analysis regression and ridge regression (Hoerl 1962; Hoerl and Kennard 1970). Ridge regression is a penalised model where extensions, such as the lasso and the elastic net also provide predictor variable sub-set selection (e.g. Zou and Hastie 2005). All such models could be adapted to a localised form and Wheeler (2007; 2009) has proposed both ridge and lasso versions of GWR to address any detrimental local collinearity effects. A related, locally-compensated ridge GWR model is detailed in Brunsdon et al (2012), Lu et al. (2014) and Gollini et al (2015). It has advantages over the ridge GWR model of Wheeler (2007) in that a ridge term is applied locally and not globally. These studies also describe associated local collinearity diagnostics for GWR, such as the use of local correlations amongst pairs of predictors, local Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) for each predictor, local variance decomposition proportions (VDPs) and the local condition numbers (CNs). The key point about locally-compensated ridge GWR, is that a local ridge term is only applied where it is needed – when the local CN is above a pre-specified value in this case 30, which is a standard heuristic. 

This study undertakes a GWR analysis, with a locally-compensated ridge term if necessary, over a 200m grid of points covering the study area, with the aim of examining the spatial distribution of coefficient estimates predicting house price and their spatial variation. Euclidean distances were used to weight data points under the kernel. These distances better reflect the spatial processes and relationships in environmental systems than network distance (Comber et al., 2008). For the kernel, an adaptive bi-square weighting function was applied, although a number of kernel functions can be specified for GW models as discussed in Gollini et al (2015). 
This generates higher weights at locations very near to the kernel centre relative to those towards the edge. For each data point ($P_j$) under the kernel (with a given bandwidth), a weight $w_{i,j}$ is calculated based on its distance to the centre of the kernel ($K_{i}$) as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
w_{i,j} = 1 - ((d_{i,j})^2 / b^2)
\end{equation}
\end{center}
where $d_{i,j}$ is the distance in metres from the centre of the kernel $K_i$ to the data point $P_j$ and $b$ is the bandwidth. 

An optimum kernel bandwidth for GWR can be found by minimising a model fit diagnostic. Options include a leave-one-out cross-validation (CV) score (Bowman 1984; Brunsdon et al. 1996). This optimises model prediction accuracy and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike 1973; Fotheringham et al. 2002) optimises model parsimony by trading off prediction accuracy and complexity. In this case, the CV approach was applied to specify all GWR models, all using the bi-square weighting kernel and distances between locations. 

The standard GWR model is:

\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
y_{i} = \beta_{i0} + \sum_{m}^{k=1}\beta_{ik}x_{ik} + \epsilon_i 
\end{equation}
\end{center}

where $y_i$ is the response variable at location $i$, $x_{ik}$ is the value of the kth predictor variable at location $i$, $m$ is the number of predictor variables, $\beta_{i0}$ is the intercept term at location $i$, $\beta_{ik}$ is the local regression coefficient for the $k^{th}$ predictor variable at location $i$ and $\epsilon_i$ is the random error at location $i$. The result of the weighting means that data nearer to the kernel centre make a greater contribution to the estimation of local regression coefficients at each local regression calibration point $i$.

# 4. Results

## 4.1 Exploratory Regressions

A standard OLS regression models was undertaken and the resultant coefficient estimates and significance values are shown in Table 1 below. PET and Wilderness were found to be significant predictors of Acer campestre distributions at the 5% level (i.e. with a less than 95% chance of occurring randomly). Interestingly, in contrast to the findings of Coudun et al (2006), mean Autumn rainfall was not found to be significantly associated with the *Acer campestre* distributions.

```

The underlying theoretical framework provided by GWR tests for non-stationarity in processes and relationships between factors. A standard GWR analysis was undertaken and in this case an optimal adaptive bandwidth of `r bw2` data points was determined using a cross-validation procedure.

The local coefficient estimates from this GWR model are shown in Table 2. They indicate considerable variation around the median in the degree to which increases in the predictor variables are associated with Acer campestre distributions. For example, considering the inter-quartile ranges shows that, in some places:

- An increase in PET of 100 values is associated with a decrease of `r tab2[2,2] * 100` trees; 
- That each increase of 0.3 in the wilderness index is associated with a decrease of 1 tree (`r tab2[4,2]` * 0.3); 
But in other locations: 
- A decrease in PET of 100 values is associated with an increase of `r tab2[2,4] * 100` trees; 
-	That each increase of 0.5 in the wilderness index is associated with an increase of 1 tree (`r tab2[4,4]` * 0.5).

The local variation in coefficient estimates in Table 2 is in contrast to the global coefficient estimates in Table 1.

## 4.2 GWR Local Collinearity Diagnostics

The potential for detrimental effects due to local collinearity has been ignored by nearly all of the GWR analyses reported in the literature, regardless of domain or subject. Collinearity occurs when one predictor variable has a strong positive or negative relationship with another, typically when it is less than -0.8 or greater than +0.8. Critically, collinearity may be absent when calculated globally (ie from all the data values), but may be present locally when a subset of the data is considered, as is the case with a GWR analysis. Table 3 shows the results of applying GWR collinearity diagnostics to the GWR model above. This generates local VDPs and local CNs at the same scale (i.e. using the same adaptive bandwidth of 21 data points). The results are summarised in Table 3 and mapped in Figure 5. These indicate a high degree of local collinearity, with CNs greater than 30 and VDPs greater than 0.5 using standard heuristics (Belsley et al 1980; O’Brien 2007), locally. These values suggest that the application of a locally-compensated ridge GWR is warranted.

```


Having tested for and identified local collinearity, a locally compensated ridge GWR (LCR-GWR) was specified. This applies a GW regression but with a locally-compensated ridge term and fits local ridge regressions with their own ridge parameters (i.e., the ridge parameter varies across space), but only does this at locations where the local Condition Number is above a user-specified threshold. In this case the CN threshold was specified as 30. An optimal adaptive bandwidth of `r lcr.bw` data points was again determined using a cross-validation procedure. Figures 6 and 7 shows the spatial distribution of the original GWR coefficients, those determined using a locally compensated ridge GWR and a map of the differences between the two, for PET and for Wilderness Quality Index. In both cases there are large and potentially important differences between the coefficient estimates from the GWR and those from the LCR-GWR.

# 5. Discussion

In this paper a series of analyses were undertaken to demonstrate the application and value of explicitly spatial analyses, focusing on GWR. These develop local statistical models in order to test for spatial non-stationarity and are in contrast to standard, a-spatial, statistical approaches that assume the relationships between factors to be the same everywhere. 

Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of considering and testing for local collinearity especially in spatial dependence models such as GWR, even where none is found to exist globally. In this analysis very strong evidence for local collinearity was found when the data were tested using local collinearity diagnostics. In most applications of GWR this critical step is missed. Where local collinearity is found a locally-compensated ridge GWR can be applied (Brunsdon et al. 2012). This only fits local ridge regressions at locations where the local CN is above a user-specified threshold. Gollini et al (2015) discuss alternative approaches for handling collinearity, but locally-compensated GWR models have the potential provide more accurate local coefficient estimates in the presence of collinearity than that found with a standard GWR model **REF needed?**.

The Geographically Weighted paradigm offers an attractive and coherent framework for many areas of applied geographical analysis. Geographically Weighted (GW) approaches develop local statistical models in order to test for spatial non-stationarity and are in contrast to standard, a-spatial, statistical approaches that assume the relationships between factors to be the same everywhere. They reflect what is commonly referred to as Tobler’s 1st Law of Geography (Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related to each other) and an understanding of the world when it is viewed through ‘Geography Goggles’. These promote a vision in which the wearer is interested in how and where things vary, does not expect (statistical) relationships to be same everywhere, does not consider the world to be not normally distributed especially in space, but rather expects processes, relationships, processes, trends etc to vary spatially and to find clusters, hotspots, coldspots, etc. 

These ideas are not new: quantitative geography in 1980s identified the need to move away from the whole map statistics, particularly Stan Openshaw’s group at Newcastle and Julian Besag’s at Durham but also Luc Anselin at Arizona. But it is important to re-state them now for a number of reasons. First, all data are spatial now (well perhaps not quite all!) but with advent of ubiquitous GPS, most records, datasets and data points have location attached to them. Second, location is not just another variable precisely because of the spatial non-stationarity observed in many processes, with the result that many phenomena are normally or randomly distributed, as predicated by classic statistical models. Third, the need to think spatially and to and to consider the spatial dimensions in a different way is given further salience by the increased access to and use of very powerful GIS software. This is increasingly resulting in instances of poor and inappropriate use of very powerful tools, but that is another story (see Comber et al., 2015). Finally, we simply observe that geography googles are not usually worn by researchers working in many areas of applied geography, especially conservation, environmental science and remote sensing, where the whole map statistic persists.
