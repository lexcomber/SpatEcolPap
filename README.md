# Abstract
This paper demonstrates the use of spatially explicit, local statistical models to explore accommodate spatial autocorrelation or spatial non-stationarity commonly observed in statistical patterns and relationships. It applies a  geographically weighted regression (GWR) to test the model suggested by Coudun et al (2006) for the presence of *Acer campestre*. However, local collinearity amongst predictor variables may be found in local models such as GWR, even when not observed globally. The analysis therefore tests for local correlations amongst variables and applies a locally compensated GWR model where it is locally needed. In this way, this paper describes the spatial variation of coefficient estimates predicting *Acer campestre* and compensates for any local correlations amongst variables using a local ridge term. In so this paper emphasises the need for Geography Goggles in applied geographical analyses of data that increasingly have a spatial component in the form of location, for instance from GPS. It argues that space is special and encourages explicitly spatial ways of thinking. These ideas are posited in the context of nearly all data being spatial (i.e location is included), and the need for slightly more informed approaches for analysing space and location than provided by standard statistical models.
